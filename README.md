# MAYO-CLINIC-Kaggle-competition
A Convolutional Neural Network to classify histopathological samples into two groups (CE and LAA)
  
    CE - Cardioembolic
    LAA - Large Artery Atheroembolism

CNN training is done using Pytorch

Data used for training and testing is a compressed form of the original data from the Mayo Clinic Competition from the Kaggle website

Also as the testing data was very small, some of the training data was split and used in testing.
